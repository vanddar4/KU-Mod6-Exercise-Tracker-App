This is the code for KU Mod-6 project final project. Jared and I have created a exercise app using the following core technologies:

    MongoDB: A document-based open source database.
    Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
    React: A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces.
    Node.js: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).


Folder/File Architecture is structured as follows:

  backend
    models
    routes
    server
  public
  src
    component
    app
    index
    css
